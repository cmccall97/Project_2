# Predicting Song Popularity Usinng Spotify Dataframe Metrics

## Overview
Everyone knows a popular song, whether it's your favorite that you cant stop listening to, or a song that you cant escape no matter where you go. But have you ever wondered what makes that song so popular? In this project, we are attempting to use a specific set of metrics in Spotify's API dataframe to find out what makes that song you're thinking of get played on repeat for ages!

## Our Database
Use our [df_cleaned](https://github.com/cmccall97/Project_2/blob/main/NEW%20DATASET.ipynb) to explore the different metrics used to grade songs and make conclusions on what drives song popularity.
